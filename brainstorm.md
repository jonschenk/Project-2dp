# Game Brainstorming

### General

- platformer
- pixel art
- 2d
- SATISFYING movement
- enemies

### Inspiration / vibe

- Celeste
- Mario (Galaxy / Odyssey life system)
- pixel art
- in space?

### Movement

- Dashing
  - Jumping + pressing and releasing crouch = dash in direction of mouse/joystick
- Crouching
  - While running, if you crouch, you will slide
- Jumping

### Combat

- hitting enemies' heads mario-style

### Levels / Layout

- Level based
- Start zone -> Checkpoint (optional) -> End zone
- global collectible (like strawberries in celeste)
- End zone is tbd but most likely like a star acts in 3d mario

### Art software options

- Aseprite

### Art ideas

- Background = Space
- Add a pre-background in some areas to simulate cave-type areas.

### Dev software options

- Unity
  - C#
  - Sketchy owners
  - Lots of premade assets and resources in general
- Godot \*
  - GDScript
  - Decent resources to learn things
  - open source
  - free to publish (big bonus)

* Leaning towards using Godot

# General game design plans

I would like to design a basic 2d mario-like game to learn what I am doing and familiarize myself with the tools and what I should use to accomplish tasks. Once I am familiar with the tools, Expand on the game and add on stretch objectives.

### TODO:

- Learn Godot/Unity (Probably Godot)
- Create basic main character and movements
- Create basic goomba-like enemy
- Create basic level
- Create end goal collectible
- Art & animations:
  - Main character
  - Enemy
  - Collectibles

### Post first iteration goals

- More than one level
- Enemy variations
- Strawberry-like collectible
